# biarms/gogs

[![Travis build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/biarms/gogs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biarms/gogs)

The goal of this very simple project is simply to publish a docker manifest merging both [Gogs](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs/) and [Gogs-rpi](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs-rpi) docker images repositories.

Resulting manifests could be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/biarms/gogs.
